This repository demonstrates a common Perl error: dereferencing an uninitialized scalar variable. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, which throws a runtime error when executed. The `bugSolution.pl` file provides a corrected version that avoids this error by properly initializing the variable.

The issue arises from the fact that Perl does not automatically initialize variables to a specific value. Attempting to dereference an uninitialized variable leads to unexpected behavior, often resulting in program crashes or unexpected outputs. The solution involves initializing the variable to a defined value before any dereferencing attempts.

This example highlights the importance of proper variable initialization in Perl to avoid runtime errors and ensure robust code.
